- Backward compatible: Gen1-only devices work unchanged
- **Throughput improvement:** Gen1 (2.5 GT/s) → Gen2 (5.0 GT/s) = **2x bandwidth**

### Multi-Lane Support (Up to 16x Parallelism)
- Support for x1, x4, x8, x16 lane configurations
- Automatic width negotiation (minimum of both partners)
- Per-lane TS lane number tracking

## Backward Compatibility

### Optional Parameters (All Default to Disabled)
All Phase 7 features are controlled by optional constructor parameters:

```python
dut = LTSSM(
    gen=1,                      # Gen1 (default) or Gen2
    lanes=1,                    # x1 (default), x4, x8, or x16
    enable_equalization=False,  # Equalization disabled by default
    enable_l0s=False,          # L0s disabled by default
    enable_l1=False,           # L1 disabled by default
    enable_l2=False,           # L2 disabled by default
    detailed_substates=False,  # Detailed substates disabled by default
)
```

### Phase 6 Baseline Tests
- All 13 Phase 6 baseline LTSSM tests continue to pass unchanged
- No modifications required to Phase 6 tests
- Default parameters preserve Phase 6 behavior exactly
- **Verification:** 100% backward compatibility maintained

### Migration Path
Users can incrementally adopt features:
1. **Phase 6 baseline:** Gen1 x1, no power management, simplified states
2. **Add Gen2:** Set `gen=2` for 2x throughput
3. **Add multi-lane:** Set `lanes=4` for 4x parallelism
4. **Add equalization:** Set `enable_equalization=True` for Gen2 signal quality
5. **Add power management:** Enable L0s/L1/L2 as needed for power savings
6. **Add detailed substates:** Set `detailed_substates=True` for spec compliance/debugging

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed Negotiation Timing
- **Gen2 negotiation:** Occurs during initial training (CONFIGURATION state)
- **Speed change:** Triggered via RECOVERY_SPEED state (~100 cycles)

- **Lane reversal detection:** Instantaneous (combinatorial logic)
- **Per-lane overhead:** Minimal (Array-based signal management)

### Equalization Timing
- **4-phase cycle:** 400 cycles total (4 phases × 100 cycles each)
- **When executed:** Only when force_equalization asserted or Gen2 speed change
- **Frequency:** Rarely after initial training (only on link errors)

### Power State Timing
- **L0s entry:** Immediate (<1 cycle)

- **L2 exit:** Full DETECT sequence (~56+ cycles)

### Throughput Potential
- **Gen1 x1 baseline:** 2.5 GT/s × 1 lane = **2.5 GT/s** (250 MB/s with 8b/10b)
- **Gen2 x1:** 5.0 GT/s × 1 lane = **5.0 GT/s** (500 MB/s with 8b/10b)
- **Gen1 x16:** 2.5 GT/s × 16 lanes = **40 GT/s** (4 GB/s with 8b/10b)

## Known Limitations

### Current Scope
- **Speed:** Gen1 (2.5 GT/s) and Gen2 (5.0 GT/s), Gen3+ deferred to Phase 9
- **Lanes:** Up to x16, but tested primarily with x1 and x4
- **Equalization:** Time-based (100 cycles/phase), not coefficient-based
- **Power states:** Basic implementation, no ASPM policy engine
- **Substates:** Simplified POLLING/RECOVERY (no .Active/.Configuration substates)

### Design Decisions
- Time-based equalization suitable for most Gen2 applications
- Simplified substates reduce complexity while maintaining PCIe compliance
- Power state entry/exit via explicit signals (no automatic ASPM policy)
- Lane reversal detection via lane numbers (standard PCIe mechanism)

### Hardware Validation Required
- Gen2 operation requires hardware validation (Phase 8)
- Multi-lane x4/x8/x16 requires appropriate PHY hardware
- Equalization effectiveness depends on PHY implementation
- Power state actual power savings depend on PHY and board design
